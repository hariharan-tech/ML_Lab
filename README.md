# ML Lab

A repository to store the programming files of Machine Learning Lab course.

## Contains:

- Hebb's rule implementation
- Perceptron neuron implementation
- Find S algorithm
- Candidate elimination algorithm
- Data visualization (getting started with matplotlib and seaborn)
- Bivariate Guassian distribution visualization (animation gif)
- K Means clustering (yet to come)
- K Near Neighbours (yet to come)


## Bivariate Guassian distribution visualizations

(May take some time to load due to high quality animations)

- Shifting mean
